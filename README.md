# FNAF-Terminal
Terminal Five Nights at Freddy's in C++.
This project aims to create a full Five Nights at Freddy's game playable in the terminal, built with C++.
Players will monitor animatronic movements across iconic rooms like the Show Stage, Pirate Cove, Kitchen, and more, using text-based camera feeds and controls.
Core mechanics such as power management, door and light controls, and animatronic AI will be implemented to capture the suspense and strategy of the original gameâ€”all within a command line interface.
